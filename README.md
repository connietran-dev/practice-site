This is a little About Me site for UI practice from week 1 of class activities.

In addition to the below features, I played around with media queries to make my site a little more mobile-friendly.

* Using `@media` queries to deal with `iframe`s and various HTML elements at a few breakpoints
* Making round images with `border-radius`
* Embedding images and YouTube videos
* Creating a variety of links including:
    * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
    * Make links bold.
    * Make placeholder links so it goes nowhere.
* Creating an unordered list of my 5 favorite bands/musicians.
* Creating an ordered list 
of steps to make a sandwich and playing around with `line-height`
* Creating and playing around with the styling of a table with a `dotted` border.
