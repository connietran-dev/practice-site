# A Little About Me

This is a little 'About Me' site for UI practice from week 1 of class activities.

You can view the live site on GitHub Pages here: https://connietran-dev.github.io/practice-site/

Here are some of the things I had fun playing around with:

* Using `@media` queries to deal with `iframe` and various HTML elements at a few different breakpoints
* Making round images with `border-radius: 50%`
* Embedding images and YouTube videos
* Creating a variety of links including:
    * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
    * Make links bold.
    * Making placeholder links so it goes nowhere.
* Creating an unordered list of my 5 favorite bands/musicians.
* Creating an ordered list 
of steps to make a sandwich and playing around with `line-height`.
* Creating and playing around with the styling of a table with a `dotted` border.
